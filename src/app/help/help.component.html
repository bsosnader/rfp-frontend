  <p class="lead">Below you'll find detailed instructions on how to prepare your documents for uploading. Following these
    instructions exactly is the best way to ensure we can get useful information from your documents.</p>
  <h3>Word Documents</h3>
  <p>There are two different ways that you can choose to parse your Word (.docx) documents. The first, and preferred method
      is to choose <em>questions</em> and <em>answers</em> that you want to be paired together in a single entry in the database,
      along with filterable tags that you fill in on the Upload page.</p>
  <p>To make questions and answers visible to the parser, follow this two step process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Highlight all text you want saved using Word's built in highlighter function with the default color.</li>
    <li>Color questions <em style="color:red">red</em> and answers <em style="color:blue">blue</em>. Use Word's "Standard
          Colors," and make sure to hover over the color and ensure that it reads "Red" and "Blue," not "Dark Red" or "Light Blue."</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The colors must follow a pattern of red, blue, red, blue, ... It should start with red and end with blue.
          Don't leave any highlighted text without a color; it will be ignored.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <div class="jumbotron">
    <p>This text will be ignored</p>
    <p style="color:red;background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5);">This is question A, it will be paired with answer A.</p>
    <p style="color:blue;background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5);">This is answer A, it will be paired with question A.</p>
    <p>This text will also be ignored</p>
    <p style="color:red;background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5);">This is question B, it will be paired with answer B.</p>
    <p style="color:blue;background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5);">This is answer B, it will be paired with question B.</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The second way of parsing requires no additional formatting, instead relying on the document already having styled Heading 1
    and Heading 2 sections. It takes all text underneath a heading and pairs it with that heading. This method is slower and leads
    to a lot of junk data that is useless being extracted. It also fails if the document's headings aren't formatted with Word's "Heading 1"
    and "Heading 2" classes. I do not recommend using this method.
  </p>

  <h3>Excel Documents</h3>
  <p>The parser accepts both .xls and .xlsx documents. Similar to Word parsing, there are two methods. The first is preferred, and
    is also similar to the highlighting method for Word documents. Here are the steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Using the "Fill Color" option (<strong>not</strong> the "Font Color"), select a cell containg a question and color it <em style="color:purple">purple</em>
    </li>
    <li>Using the "Fill Color" option again, select the cell containing the answer and color it <em style="color:yellow">yellow</em></li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This methods assumes a few things: that a question and answer are on the same row,
    that there are no more than one question and answer per row, and that each question and answer is contained within a single cell.</p>
  <p><strong>Why yellow and purple?</strong> Yellow and purple were chosen because it is probably unlikely that a company has already
    used these colors as fill colors elsewhere in the document. If they do, the parser will read those cells in as well, and possibly break.
    You can fix it by removing the fill colors from those sections.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <div class="jumbotron">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td style="background:rgba(128,0,128,0.5)">This is question A</td>
          <td>This will be ignored</td>
          <td style="background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5)">This is answer A</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>This is all ignored</td>
          <td>This is all ignored</td>
          <td>This is all ignored</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background:rgba(128,0,128,0.5)">This is question B</td>
          <td style="background:rgba(255,230,0,0.5)">This is answer B</td>
          <td>This is ignored</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    </div>
    <p><strong>Final Note:</strong> The colors on this page may not look exactly like the ones in Word or Excel. Choose based on
      the exact names of the colors: red, blue, purple, yellow, not how they look precisely on this page.</p>

    <p>The second method for parsing Excel documents simply takes the name of an entire sheet, and puts that in along with all of
      text from that sheet as a single entry. As you can imagine, this is slow and results in basically meaningless entries. It
      is not recommended to use this method. </p>
